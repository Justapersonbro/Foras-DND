Was fairly weak as a child. He didn't excel in much. He always found enjoyment in sitting by the trees and watching. He was very unsocial as a child, preferring to observe things around him and people from afar. He birdwatched often.

There's some lore I gotta put in here. I won't be doing that right now. 
Should probably flesh out family troubles and why he left/got lost in a forest.

Might delete this all and just have him be dropped off there as a child. Not sure. I'll figure it out.

[[Erdan Amalith]] was the mentor and adoptive father of [[Dorn Evenwood]]. He taught Dorn everything that he knows about his heritage as a Tiefling. Having never seen others of his kind, Dorn felt greatly relieved. He wasn't the only one out there; He wasn't just some freak of nature! He was more than that. Others might always see him that way, but that didn't bother him so much, he was just glad to know he wasn't alone. Dorn, with the support of Erdan, claimed the name [[Foras (Demon)|Foras]]. Eventually he took Erdan's last name as well, saying he considered him more of a father than Helm ever was.
