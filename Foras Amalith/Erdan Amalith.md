Adoptive father of [[Foras Amalith]].
Elf Druid.
Offered housing and food to a young, frail, Tiefling child that he found in the woods. That boy was [[Dorn Evenwood]]. He taught Dorn all about his heritage as a Tiefling, giving him wisdom and sharing history. Having never seen others of his kind, Dorn felt greatly relieved. He wasn't the only one out there; He wasn't just some freak of nature! He was more than that. Others might always see him that way, but that didn't bother him so much, he was just glad to know he wasn't alone.

I'll flesh him out more later, once I actually read more about elves.
