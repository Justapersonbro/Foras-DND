[[Character Sheet]]
Foras Amalith is a young and easily nervous Tiefling Druid. He's good intentioned. He's originally from [[ToBeAdded]].
His birth name was [[Dorn Evenwood]], but he changed it later into his teens, as he didn't feel much of a connection with it.
The biological son of [[Rowan Evenwood]] and [[Melech]]. He isn't aware of Melech's existence. He will probably never be aware of his existence.
He was raised by an Elf known by the name [[Erdan Amalith]]. Foras considers Erdan to be his father and mentor. 

Wants to join the [[Emerald Enclave]]. Might change this later since I haven't read too much about it.

[[Erdan Amalith]] took him in when he was young. Erdan taught him history and medicine, along with introducing him to druidic magic. He taught Foras to respect nature, and in turn, Foras learnt it's secrets (Cheesy, but I'm not here to be an author. I'm here to help people kill monsters). Spent from ages 13-19 with [[Erdan Amalith]].  When he was 19 he got a letter, and, in his curiosity, asked to leave to investigate. Erdan was a little wary, as it looked suspicious. 

He went anyways because he's a little shit.
Joking. That's out of character. I'll make up a good reason soon.
