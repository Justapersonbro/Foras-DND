A wizard from [[ToBeAdded]]. He studied at the [[School of Evocation]]. He works with local military training other wizards so they can be useful soldiers. 
Was constantly disappointed by his son, [[Dorn Evenwood]], as the boy was not only a Tiefling but also an all around weak, useless boy. Dorn didn't take to magic, nor weapons, nor fighting, nor blacksmithing. He was proficient in nothing of use to the family. Helm felt him to be a curse for his wrongdoings in life. Helm was unaware that the child wasn't biologically his. Dorn, who now bares the name [[Foras Amalith]], still isn't aware of this either.
